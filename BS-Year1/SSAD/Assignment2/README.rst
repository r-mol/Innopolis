==================
Matrix Determinant
==================

Write a C++ Program that computes the Determinant of any giving square matrix.
What need to do is to read the matrix from input.txtevery row is separated by - and Write it's Determinant to output.txt

Example 1
*********
input.txt

.. code:: text

      {{8,0,3},{0,3,9},{0,2,2}}
 
output.txt

.. code:: text

     -96
     
Example 2
*********
input.txt

.. code:: text

      {{9,4,8},{1,3,1},{7,2,6}}
 
output.txt

.. code:: text

     -4

==============
Matrix Inverse
==============

Write a C++ Program that Inverse any 3*3 Matrix.
What need to do is to read the matrix from input.txt and Write the inverted matrix in output.txt 
please note that following when writing to the output file:
 ∙ The matrix must be printed as 3*3 with 1 space between neighbour numbers
 ∙ Always show the only 2 decimal numbers after the decimal point and truncate the rest e.g 1.1912345 become 1.19
 ∙ You can use this function to help you with the formatting and truncation printf("%.2f ", number)

Example 1
*********
input.txt

.. code:: text

      {{8,5,4},{8,5,1},{4,3,2}}
 
output.txt

.. code:: text

     0.58 0.17 -1.25
    -1.00 0.00 2.00
     0.33 -0.33 0.00
     
Example 2
*********
input.txt

.. code:: text

      {{8,6,2},{8,4,8},{4,6,2}}
 
output.txt

.. code:: text

     0.25 0.00 -0.25
     -0.10 -0.05 0.30
     -0.20 0.15 0.10
