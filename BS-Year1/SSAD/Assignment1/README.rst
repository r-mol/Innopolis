===========
Largest Sum
===========

Find the contiguous subarray (having at least one number) with the largest sum in an integer array nums and return its sum. 
A subarray is a section of an array that is contiguous.

Sample
******
input.txt

.. code:: text

      nums = -2 1 -3 4 -1 2 1 -5 4
 
output.txt

.. code:: text

     6

==========
Substrings
==========

You are given a string s as well as an array of strings words of the same length. Return all starting indices of substring(s) in s that are a concatenation of each word in words once, in any order, and without any intervening characters.

Sample
******
input.txt

.. code:: text

      s = barfoothefoobarman, words = ["foo","bar"]
 
output.txt

.. code:: text

     [0,9]

===========
Linked List
===========

Return the head of a linked list after swapping every two adjacent nodes. You must solve the problem without changing the values in the nodes of the list (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

Sample
******
input.txt

.. code:: text

      head = 1 2 3 4

output.txt

.. code:: text

     2 1 4 3
