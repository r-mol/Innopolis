The difference between FCFS, SJF and Round Robin, that first one just take the processes in order it comes. Second,
at first it sorts processes by arrival time and after by burst time. And it chooses the process with the shortest burst time in
an available set of processes. But as for Round Robin, it executes processes in quantum every time. That is why, it works like
queue, because it executes all processes sequentially. This scheduler is also dependent on quantum on your machine
because it divides all processes on quantum interval.
