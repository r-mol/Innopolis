The difference between FCFS and SJF, that first one just take the processes in order it comes. But as for SJF,
at first it sorts processes by arrival time and after by burst time. And it chooses the process with the shortest burst time in
an available set of processes. Comparing with FCFS, SJF always will have less average waiting time, because it will always
take process with the shortest burst time. And that is why turnaround time of processes will be shorter.
