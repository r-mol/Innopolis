From the execution time output of the program is clearly see, that when we divide one big task
on m small tasks which executed by m threads, we get better result than one thread execute this task.
Because all threads executed in parallel and do the small tasks and after combine results in the total result.
That is why in this case we will decrease execution time by increasing number of threads but till the number of elements
in array.
