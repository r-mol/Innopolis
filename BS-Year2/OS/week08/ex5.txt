The two sorts of addresses that specify the distinctive places in the memory are
virtual and physical addresses. The user is able to view the virtual address,
but not the physical addresses. The physical address in the main memory can be
accessed using the virtual address as a reference. Physical addresses and virtual
or logical addresses have certain common distinctions.

The fact that the virtual address is generated by the CPU when a program is
being executed is one of the main distinctions between these two addresses.
Additionally, a place in the memory unit is all that the physical address is.
