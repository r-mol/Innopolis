In order to byte address 8 KB, we require 2^13 entries. If we consider the 
Virtual Address given to us of 16 bits, this gives us 16âˆ’13=3 bits. These are
the bits that are used for indexing into the page table for determining the
address of the page or 'frame' in main memory. That is why 13 bits is offset and
3 bits is for entries 8 pages.
